Thus, the duration of all injuries is randomly and evenly distributed in the interval:

If this check fails then a Grave Injury will be inflicted on the officer instead. Increasing this value correspondingly reduces the chance officers will die when badly wounded.",,,Injuries

The base value in vanilla is 8. Settings this value below that will have no effect.

If already in-game, requires reloading your save for any changes to take effect."
